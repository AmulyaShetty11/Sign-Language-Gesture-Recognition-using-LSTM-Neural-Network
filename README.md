# Sign-Language-Gesture-Recognition-using-LSTM-Neural-Network
This project involves the practical implementation of sign language gesture detection using deep learning techniques, specifically LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks. The objective is to develop a system capable of recognizing and classifying three fundamental sign language gestures: "Hello," "I love you," and "Thanks."
