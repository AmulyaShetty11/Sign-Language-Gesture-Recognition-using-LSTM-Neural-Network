# Project Description: Sign Language Detection using LSTM Neural Network

## Overview:
This project aims to develop a practical implementation of sign language estimation using an LSTM Neural Network built with TensorFlow's Keras. The system will detect three specific gestures: "hello," "I love you," and "thanks." It involves several steps, from gathering data to training the model and evaluating its performance.

## Steps Involved:

### 1.Import and Install Dependencies:

Install necessary libraries and packages such as TensorFlow, Keras, and MediaPipe Holistic for keypoint extraction.

### 2.Keypoints using MP Holistic:

Utilize MediaPipe Holistic to capture keypoints from video input, extracting essential body language information.

### 3.Extract Keypoint Values:

Process the captured video frames to extract the keypoint values of relevant body parts for sign language interpretation.

### 4.Setup Folders for Collection:

Organize directories to store collected data for training and testing.

### 5.Collect Keypoint Values for Training and Testing:

Record and collect keypoint data by performing the three specific sign language gesturesâ€”hello, I love you, and thanks.

### 6.Preprocess Data and Create Labels/Features:

Preprocess the collected data, splitting it into training and testing datasets. Create labels and features necessary for training the LSTM network.

### 7.Build and Train LSTM Neural Network:

Construct an LSTM-based neural network using TensorFlow's Keras API. Train the model using the labeled dataset.

### 8.Make Predictions:

Utilize the trained model to predict sign language gestures from new data or real-time input.

### 9.Save Weights:

Save the trained model weights for future use or deployment.

### 10.Evaluation using Confusion Matrix and Accuracy:

Evaluate the model's performance using a confusion matrix and accuracy metrics to assess its ability to correctly identify the sign language gestures.

### 11.Test in Real Time:

Implement real-time testing to demonstrate the model's functionality in recognizing sign language gestures in live video streams.


## Conclusion:
This project aims to demonstrate the practical implementation of sign language gesture detection using LSTM Neural Networks, offering a potential solution for real-time interpretation and communication for individuals using sign language. The project's success will be measured by its accuracy in recognizing the predefined gestures and its ability to perform in real-world scenarios.
